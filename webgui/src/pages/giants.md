Successfully moving in the direction of artificial intelligence (AI) is easiest
on the shoulders of giants in vision and ability to perform. Thank you to all of them!

::: warning !!! Construction Site !!!
You are looking at a construction site while construction is going on. Please, keep this in mind if you move on ... at your own risk ;-)

## Approach here

Our approach to get an AI solution running is to use a powerful stack provided by giants and
to add only a thin layer of custom application code:


<div><object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://enpasos.ai/approach.svg" width="100%"/></div>

In this way, we try to take useful steps towards AI.

The giants' spirit of openly sharing successes is accelerating all of our journeys towards AI. It goes without saying that the tiny part we can contribute to this journey will also be released under an open source licence.

Not to mention that this website is based on the [Quasar Docs](https://quasar.dev/docs) and other open source components.
