David Silver at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) reveals a very general principle that is appealingly
simple and intuitive to understand:

Allowing an agent to decide which actions to optimise based solely on the observations and rewards got from the environment
seems sufficient to achieve a high level of intelligent action.

::: tip Reward-Is-Enough hypothesis
"Intelligence, and its associated abilities, can be understood as subserving the maximisation of reward by an agent acting in its environment."

A success story that already show a high level of intelligent action based on the pattern:

DeepMind's success stories in the area of reinforcement learning go well beyond classical games:
